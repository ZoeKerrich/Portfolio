## Portfolio
I am in the final semester of a graduate program for city and regional planning at
the Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania. My work in this program
focuses on water infrastructure resilience, geospatial modeling techniques for land use
and environmental planning, and addressing legacy contamination in Rust Belt communities
through a mix of policy and design interventions. You can find some samples of my work in each
of these areas below.

### Water Infrastructure Case Studies 

[LoSIMS: Local-scale Stormwater Infrastructure Monitoring System](http://www.sensingthecity.com/losims/)
As part of an interdisciplinary team, I designed a sensor-based system to monitor
stormwater inlet blockage and failure. Data from sensor systems have the potential
to inform long-term infrastructural investments.
